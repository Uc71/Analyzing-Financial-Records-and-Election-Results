# Analyzing Financial Records and Election Results
This is my 2nd attempt at the 1st python challenge.

Here, I use Python in Visual Studio Code to compute the number of months in a bank's accounting records 
and the net profit that they made in the accounting period. 
I also calculate the average monthly change in profit or loss from the previous month's profit/loss value. 
I identify the month and amount of the greatest increase and the greatest decrease between monthly profit/loss values. 

I then proceed to analyze an election. 
For the election analysis, I count how many votes were cast, 
how many candidates there were who received at least 1 vote, 
the percentage of votes won by each candidate, 
the total vote sum for each candidate, 
and the election winner's identity.
